<h1>Caesar Cipher Implementation</h1>
  <p>
    This project showcases the implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and the strategy design pattern. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
  </p>
  <h2>OOP Concepts Demonstrated</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Abstraction: The algorithm is encapsulated within classes and methods, abstracting away the details of the encryption and decryption process.</li>
    <li>Encapsulation: The algorithm's implementation is encapsulated within classes, providing data hiding and ensuring that the encryption and decryption logic is contained within the appropriate objects.</li>
    <li>Inheritance: The project may utilize inheritance to extend the functionality of existing classes or to create specialized variants of the cipher.</li>
    <li>Interface: The CipherStrategy interface defines the contract for different encryption strategies, allowing for interchangeable implementations.</li>
    <li>Polymorphism: The use of the CipherStrategy interface enables polymorphism, allowing different encryption strategies to be used interchangeably.</li>
    <li>Modularity: The implementation is modular, with separate classes for the Caesar Cipher algorithm and the client test class, promoting code organization and maintainability.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Strategy Design Pattern</h2>
  <p>
    The strategy design pattern is employed in this project to facilitate different encryption strategies. The CipherContext class acts as the context and maintains a reference to a concrete implementation of the CipherStrategy interface. This allows for runtime selection and substitution of different encryption strategies, such as varying shift values in the case of the Caesar Cipher.
  </p>
  <h2>Functionality</h2>
  <p>
    The implemented Caesar Cipher algorithm provides the following functionality:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encryption: The algorithm can encrypt plaintext messages by shifting each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.</li>
    <li>Decryption: The algorithm can decrypt ciphertext messages by shifting each letter in the message by the reverse of the encryption shift.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.</li>
    <li>Open the <code>CeasarCipherTest.java</code> file located in the <code>pkgCeasarCipherTest</code> package.</li>
    <li>Compile and run the <code>CeasarCipherTest</code> class.</li>
    <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to choose encryption or decryption, provide the shift value, and enter the message to be encrypted or decrypted.</li>
    <li>View the output, which will display the encrypted or decrypted message.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to compile and run the Java source code.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates the implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm using OOP concepts and the strategy design pattern. By utilizing encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, and modularity, the project achieves a flexible and modular design for message encryption and decryption. The strategy design pattern allows for interchangeable encryption strategies, providing extensibility and customization options.
